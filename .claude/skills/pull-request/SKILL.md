name: pull-request
description: Create or update a Pull Request with a description tailored to its conventional-commit type (feat, fix, refactor, chore, perf, or trivial). Auto-detects whether to create or update based on branch state, detects type from branch/commits/issues, fills the matching bundled template, and runs verification only for what CI does not cover. Use when invoking /pull-request, when the user asks to open or update a PR, or after pushing work that needs a PR.

# Pull Request

## Quick start

```
/pull-request                       # auto-detect: update if PR exists for branch, else create
/pull-request create                # force create (errors if PR exists for branch)
/pull-request update                # force update (errors if no PR for branch)
/pull-request 158                   # update specific PR (number → implies update)
/pull-request feat                  # auto-detect action, force type
/pull-request create feat           # create + force type
/pull-request update 158 fix        # update PR 158 + force type
/pull-request create draft          # create as draft
```

## Workflow

1. **Determine action.**
   - `gh pr view --json number,url` for current branch.
   - PR exists → `update`. No PR → `create`. Bare number arg → `update <n>`. Explicit `create`/`update` overrides.
   - If `gh repo set-default` is unset, surface the error — do not guess the repo.

2. **Identify PR / branch context.**
   - `update`: confirm PR number and base branch (`gh pr view --json baseRefName`).
   - `create`: confirm current branch (`git branch --show-current`); base branch defaults to repo default (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`); check push state via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` (errors when no upstream).

3. **Gather detection signals + propose type.** Skip when the user passed an explicit type override.
   - `git branch --show-current` — check for a conventional-commit prefix (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`, `ci/…`, `build/…`, `style/…`, `test/…`, `perf/…`; `/` or `-` separator).
   - `git log <base>..HEAD --pretty=%s%n%b` — extract conventional-commit prefix and `!` marker from each subject; scan bodies for `BREAKING CHANGE:` footers.
   - For each linked issue (branch regex `^(feat|fix|refactor|chore|docs|ci|build|style|test|perf)[/-](\d+)[-_]` + `Closes #N`/`Fixes #N` references in commits): `gh issue view <n> --json state,labels,title`.
   - **Propose type:**
     - Strong agreement → propose with reasoning, confirm.
     - Conflicting signals → propose best-guess with signal table, confirm.
     - **Zero signal** → "No conventional-commit signals detected" + override list, user picks.
   - Map detected type to template: `docs|ci|build|style|test` → `trivial`.
   - Wait for confirmation before continuing.

4. **Load the matching template.** Read `templates/<type>.md` from this skill's directory. Templates are bundled here for portability — do not read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` or `docs/pr_template.md`.

5. **Gather PR content.**
   - `gh pr diff <n>` (update) or `git diff <base>..HEAD` (create).
   - `gh pr view <n> --json commits` (update) or `git log <base>..HEAD` (create).
   - Read referenced files for context where needed.

6. **Fill the template.**

   **Universal fill rules:**
   - Strip guidance HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) before saving the body.
   - Always populate "Out of scope" where the section exists — forces explicit scope on AI-authored PRs.
   - When an issue is linked, keep prose terse — only deltas/deviations from the issue.
   - Surface architectural decisions, not line-by-line diff narration.

   **Auto-injections:**
   - **Linked issue.** If branch encodes an issue and `gh issue view <n>` returns `state: OPEN`, inject `Closes #<n>`. If `CLOSED` or missing, skip and surface in the HITL gate. Update mode: only inject when the existing body's "Linked issue" section is empty.
   - **Multi-issue.** When ≥2 issue references found across commits/branch, inject `Closes #129, #130` (comma-separated).
   - **Breaking changes.** When commits contain `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, inject `## Breaking changes` into `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` templates with one paragraph on what breaks + migration guidance. Omit the section entirely when no breaking change is detected.

   **Verification.** Verification checkboxes are for manual steps only — UI/UX checks, external service interactions, things a reviewer must do by hand. Never list project build/test/lint commands; CI reports those itself. If a PR has no manual steps, omit the verification section entirely. Only run local verification for what CI cannot validate (third-party integrations, external system state); on failure, stop and surface to the user before updating the PR.

   **Update mode: preserve checked verification boxes.** Read existing PR body via `gh pr view <n> --json body`. For each `- [x] <text>` whose text appears unchanged in the new body, apply `- [x]`. Drop any check whose text is no longer present and note in the post-update summary.

   **Create mode: generate title.** Format `<type>: <subject>` or `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` — prefix matches body type. Subject source priority: linked-issue title (strip leading type prefix) → top commit subject (strip prefix) → synthesized from diff (ask user if fallback hit). Scope lifted from commits when consistent across history; omitted when mixed. Length ≤72 chars; truncate subject, never prefix.

7. **Save artifact.**
   - `update`: `thoughts/prs/{number}_description.md` (overwrite if exists).
   - `create`: `thoughts/prs/{branch-slug}_description.md` (slug = branch name with `/` → `-`); rename to `{number}_description.md` after `gh pr create` returns the number.

8. **HITL gate.** Single `y/edit/n`.

   **Update mode:**
   ```
   Filled body saved to thoughts/prs/{number}_description.md.
   Apply to PR #{number}? (y/edit/n)
   ```

   **Create mode:**
   ```
   About to create PR:
     Title:  feat: relay inbound Twilio SMS to action queue
     Base:   main
     Mode:   ready
     Push:   feat/129-twilio-sms-relay → origin (will run git push -u origin)
     Body:   thoughts/prs/feat-129-twilio-sms-relay_description.md

   Confirm? (y/edit/n)
   ```

   `edit` opens the body file (or surfaces the path); title/base/draft are re-prompted inline if the user wants to alter them after editing, then the gate is shown again. Default ready in create mode; opt into draft via `draft` positional arg or `wip/`/`draft/` branch prefix. `n` aborts cleanly; the saved artifact remains for the next run.

9. **Execute.**
   - Create: `git push -u origin <branch>` (if unpushed) → `gh pr create --base <base> --title <title> --body-file <file>` (add `--draft` if draft mode). Rename the artifact to `{number}_description.md`.
   - Update: `gh pr edit {number} --body-file thoughts/prs/{number}_description.md`.
   - Surface URL, any unchecked manual-verification steps, and any dropped checked items (update mode).

## Notes

- **Portable:** templates live in `templates/` next to this file. Drop the skill into any repo and it works — no `.github/` or `docs/` setup required.
- Use the **writing-clearly-and-concisely** skill when filling prose sections.
